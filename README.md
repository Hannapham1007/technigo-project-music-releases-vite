# Music Releases
The task given us was to create a site in React displaying music releases, using an API from Spotify.

It was a co-operation between Karolina Shi, Klara Kindlund and me and was done with a pair programming aproach.

We started by discussing the project and how we should build it, as well as starting dividing the different components between each other, as well as deiciding on the structure of the page.
